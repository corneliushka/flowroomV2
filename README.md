Description

Contexte : when reading the book Flow : The Psychology of Optimal Experience by Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi, i was inspired to craft an app to document and monitoring my learning journey of web developpement. Also, by working on it, I can learn the clogs and tricks of React, a broad knowledge of Javascript ES6, Design System & web technologies. This project has mainly a learning purpose.
